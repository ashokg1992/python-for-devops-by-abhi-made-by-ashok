- what are data types ? go to  day-2 doc, 
     string, numeric(int,float), sequence(list,tuple), mapping, boolean.

Q) why python is dynamically programming?
    bcz for python , no need interpretor , it automaticlly understand what type of data it is. like if we mention a=10 , no need to declare as int a=10 , it undrsand by itself.
    - "ashok" - it means for python  is - it is a string
    - while declaring variables, we do not need to mention to the variable that  what type of  value is assigned to them , bcz it automatically undersand  , that is why it is dynamically programming.
    in shell : var name string  ="ashok" # we  telling that ashok as string and teliing this to var name
    in python : name = "ashok" # no need to tell

Q) how you  get only firrst name  in the file whihc has first and sencond names to each person?
    - by using inbuilt funciotn 
    string.split(" ")

Q) what is concatanation?
     to add two values / stirngs is called concatanation


Q) how you find number of characters in string or group of string?
     byusing len  function.

Q)if you want to get nedagative value to positve value then what  fucntion you se?
     abs  # absolute funciotn


Q) what is regular expression ?
     to ger perticular pattern in the list, we use reg expression insted of using for loop
    - read day -2 examples FOLDER


Q) how does  devops engineer use this regular expression in real time?
    let say there is huge log file (might be it is applicaiotn log/infra log/ audit log), inside it there are bunchof errorlogs/warinng logs/, by using this reg expression we get those logs.
    - or we can get those erros by iterateing  file  by using for loop,


REAL TIME TASK:
------------
-in aws, for each reosurce it has arn (amazon resource name)
- let day we have arn's  for IAM users, now we get the usernames  from arns. 
- write python script  to collect arns, then by using  inbuilt fucntions ( string.split) we get data.
- we get complte json payload, then we convert into dictionary, from dictonay we split and get data as we required
- see day-2 examples folder.


 <!-- in nay progaram : key-words, data types, operators , logical reasoning is imporatntat  -->
- some of the jeywords in pythons : if,else, try, except..
- 

- try,except, finally  are error handling key words
