### ===============================================

- TO interact with k8 , CLIis- kubectl
- to interact with aws , CLI  is- aws ( aws s3 ls)
- like this we can interact with  CLIs .


- we can also interact with  APIs  to get info.
-  in normal , by URL just paste in browser, then we get data
- but in python we can get data same as above by using " requests.get " 

# to talk with any resource, we do following these:
     - identify the requried module, requets method
     -  API URL 
     - data manipulation
     -print the data 


### ===============================================
-   string
- group of strings  called  list
- key:value is called dictionary


REAL TIME TASK:
-----------
-- talk to github API, nad getting info as and when required
- 	getting into github and fecthing issues and who crated it  .. this can be done by script

 

- what are data types ? go to  day-2 doc, 
     string, numeric(int,float), sequence(list,tuple), mapping, boolean.

Q) why python is dynamically programming?
    bcz for python , no need interpretor , it automaticlly understand what type of data it is. like if we mention a=10 , no need to declare as int a=10 , it undrsand by itself.
    - "ashok" - it means for python  is - it is a string
    - while declaring variables, we do not need to mention to the variable that  what type of  value is assigned to them , bcz it automatically undersand  , that is why it is dynamically programming.
    in shell : var name string  ="ashok" # we  telling that ashok as string and teliing this to var name
    in python : name = "ashok" # no need to tell

Q) how you  get only firrst name  in the file whihc has first and sencond names to each person?
    - by using inbuilt funciotn 
    string.split(" ")


 <!-- FOR PRACTICING INBULIT FUNCTIONS , GO TO DAY-2 EXAMPLES FOLDER -->


Q) what is concatanation?
     to add two values / stirngs is called concatanation


Q) how you find number of characters in string or group of string?
     byusing len  function.

Q)if you want to get nedagative value to positve value then what  fucntion you se?
     abs  # absolute funciotn


Q) what is regular expression ?
     to ger perticular pattern in the list, we use reg expression insted of using for loop
    - read day -2 examples FOLDER


Q) how does  devops engineer use this regular expression in real time?
    let say there is huge log file (might be it is applicaiotn log/infra log/ audit log), inside it there are bunchof errorlogs/warinng logs/, by using this reg expression we get those logs.
    - or we can get those erros by iterateing  file  by using for loop,


REAL TIME TASK:
------------
-in aws, for each reosurce it has arn (amazon resource name)
- let day we have arn's  for IAM users, now we get the usernames  from arns. 
- write python script  to collect arns, then by using  inbuilt fucntions ( string.split) we get data.
- we get complte json payload, then we convert into dictionary, from dictonay we split and get data as we required
- see day-2 examples folder.


 <!-- in nay progaram : key-words, data types, operators , logical reasoning is imporatntat  -->
- some of the jeywords in pythons : if,else, try, except..
- 

- try,except, finally :  are error handling key words 

Q) what are modules  you used in python?
      boto3


REAL TIME TASK IN PYTHON:
-----------------
- in org, scripts can be written in python by using aws sdk and cdk, cft, tf
- write scripts for s3 bucket(  accessing.. etc) 
- write the script to  crating jira  ticket for the issues
- to list out issues and pull requests in repository , we write functions for this.
- written the modules to connecting AWS RESOURCES, GITHUB API, JIRA API, HTTPS REQUEST API.. 
- FOR THE ABOVE      aws(boto3 mocule ), jira(jira mdoule), github(github module), http (request mdule) used


=================================== PYPI:  =================================

 - PYTHON PACKAGE INDEX
 - PYPI is central repository to store packages like docker hub, whether it can be private or public.
 - we write packages and stored them in private repository or public
 -  by using pip , we can download anuthing form PIPY .
 - pip install boto3
 - pip install github
 - pip install jira
 - somoe packages are : numpy, panda
 - pip list    # to show all packages that we have in termianal 
 - functions -> modules -> packages  # this is order  
 - python get-pip.py     # to install pip  in linux 
 - py get-pip.py     # to install pip  in windows 

=========================  VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT =====================================


pip install virtualenv 	# to install sepeaate environment  for the different projects in same machine
python -m  venv project-abc	# -m : mdoule ; venv: virtual env ; by this command , it create folder for this project
source project-abc/bin/activate 	# to go to this project folder
pipinstall jira 	# it means it is installed in this project-abc envirionment space folder , not in other folder env space.
- pip list | grep jira
- # like this we can install different version of jira in different env space/ project, so that it can not affect any project.
- deactivate	# to get out of this env space


 
========================  VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT =====================================


========================  ========================
- OS  module is use in one case - to read env variables
- sys  module is used:
- 

= ============ float division ( //) ====================
3//2 = 1  # we dont get decimals in this.
============== - modulus: (%) =================
- 16 % 13 = 3  in python this is moduls
-16/13= 1.22
-16//13 = 1
-16%13= 3


====================================  ================================

-CONDITIONAL HANDLING:
1.if
2.else
3.elif(elseif)


====================================  ================================

- list : ["a": "b": "c":]

## ============= real time task =========================

- to print list of all s3 buckets/ebs volumes/ec2 instances  in perticular account .

Q) diff b/n LIST & TUPLE?
     LIST - mutable
     tuple- immutable
  
     LIST
     -----------
          - ONCE  list  is crated, it is resizable
          - we can add no of users/list of buckets/ec2 instaces
          - dynamic memory it has bcz data is changes everyitme
          -["a","b"]



     TUPLE:
     -------
          - ONCE  tuple is crated, it CAN'T be resizable
          - if we do not want  to add/ delete , then we use this tuple.
          - if i do not want to add admin user names by unauthorized users, then we use it.
          - memory is fixed
          -("a","b")

Q) how to add new element to lisst?
     - for that variable whihc is assigned to list, add "append" to that varialbe.


## ===== slicing =================

- to get data from 0 to x in the list
- if range is exceeded, then also program is executed
- 
a= ["a", "b","c","d","e"]
print(a[2:4])


## =====  SORT  =================

-ARRANGE in alpabectic order
-


Q) in LIST  can we store same or diff typeof data in it?
     - we can store any type of data (string, int, float)


## =================  REAL TIME TASK  ==============================

LIST  ALL FILES IN LIST OF FOLDERS  THAT USER PROVIDED , AND MAX SIZE OF FILE IN THAT FOLDER
- INPUT:  given path of folder ( /tmp/)
-OUTPUT: (files in /opt )

Q) we can give inputs to program in the run time, ways?
          -1.command line arguments
          - env vars
          - input method ( it executes at run time)


Q) split function?
     - it can convert data into a list type.
     - if we give random folders names list, then split convert  that list  into LIST TYPE

Q)    what is OS module?
     - it interact with OS and give info.
     - OS.LISTDIR   # IT TELL ALL FILES IN FOLDER
     - 
Q) exceptional handling?
     - insted of  throwing error in program , we can skip  that error and execute reamin program, then weuse exceptional handling.
     - we use TRY , EXCEPT  blocks for this 


### ================== DICTIONARY ====================
- single dictionary 
- multiple dictionary : if we want to use multiple dictionary , dictionaries are used in list 

students_info= [                # list 
    {     # dictionary
        
    },
    {
          # dictionary
    }
]


### ========== SETS{ }  =========================

     -- sets are represnting by using symbol : {  } 

###  -- REAL TIME TASK OF SETS: ================
     --  while creating  s3 buckets, buckets  names are to be identical
     -- in this case , we use sets, and prevent duplicate names at the time of crating buckets.
     -- 

### ====================== FILE OPERATIONS =================

    --   REAL TIME TASK  OF FILE OPERATION :
    ---------------------------------------
          -- TO UPDATE  server configuation when any metrics met.
          --to update application properties file, then we  use file operations
          -- to update any file , we use file operations
--- file operations:
          -- 1. read operations
          --2.   write operations

Q) to open a file , whihc function you ses ?
     - " with  open ("path", "read/write")


------------------------
-- with open ("/opt/tmp", "r")   # to read mode for a file
--rules for while doing file operations:
          --  read file by opening it
          -- read data and store data to a variable
          --now enable write mode to  that file to update data
          -- now write data as our wish
          --
